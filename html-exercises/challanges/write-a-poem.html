        <h1>Black</h1>
        <p>
            Nothing is darker than black<br>
            And its definition is light's lack <br>
            It is more dark than darkness <br>
            And less lighter than lightness <br>
            <br>
            But why do we fear it ?<br>
            Why do we run away from it?<br>
            It is only a color pack<br>
            There's White, There's Grey, There's Balck
